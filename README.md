# dictionarpy
CLI tool to get Merriam-Webster Definitions and Synonyms

I like to jot down new words, or words I forgot the meaning of, as I read to help expand new words. Usually, I'll just Google the definition of the word. If it is
a word I think I will continue using I put the word into my notes on my phone or add it to a text file on my computer. This text file acts as a database of words I would like
to add to my vocabulary. Instead of doing this everytime I come across a word, I've decided that its time to automate this.

Ultimately, I want the ability to look up a word when I come across it. Then, I want to be able to add a new word to the database. Finally, I'll write some scripts to quiz me on the words.

This is just for fun, but we will see what it turns into.
